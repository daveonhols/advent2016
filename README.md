I used Advent of Code this year to learn Javascript & Node
It's been fun!!!
I have made slightly slow progress hence only completing in March as I do work full time as a developer
However I am happy with the end result.
I have learned pure JS and Node as well as profiling, linting and unit testing.

Interesting points:

Day 11 was the hardest and part 2 was the only one I had to look for hints on, that was reducing the search space to a canonical representation
A* search came up a few times and I have reused my A* solver on a few puzzles.
CPU simulator came up a lot of times and I wrestled with making it faster by pulling everything in line rather than switching and apply ing on a function.
I wrote a custom data structure for D19 part 2 to make deleting from large arrays faster
Day 22 would be cool to make it as an interactive game you could shuffle the data around by clicking on a web page.
All MD5 puzzles are slow in JS, seems all MD5 implementations are not that great.   I tested a few and found the fastest was ('spark-md5').hash
